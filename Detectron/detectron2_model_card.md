# Model Card for Detectron2

Detectron2 is a high-performance codebase for object detection, segmentation, and other computer vision tasks. Developed by Facebook AI Research (FAIR), it is a successor to the original Detectron framework, providing improved modularity, extensibility, and scalability for both research and production use cases.

## Model Details

### Model Description

Detectron2 is a state-of-the-art library designed to handle complex computer vision tasks such as object detection, segmentation (instance, semantic, and panoptic), and keypoint detection. It is built on top of the PyTorch deep learning framework, offering a rich set of pre-trained models and flexible configuration options, making it suitable for a wide range of applications from academic research to industrial deployment.

## Uses

### Direct Use

Detectron2 can be used directly for a variety of computer vision tasks such as:
- Detecting objects in images (Object Detection).
- Segmenting objects in images (Instance and Semantic Segmentation).
- Detecting human keypoints (Keypoint Detection).

### Downstream Use [optional]

When fine-tuned, Detectron2 models can be adapted for specific tasks like:
- Autonomous driving systems for identifying pedestrians and vehicles.
- Medical imaging for detecting and segmenting tumors or other anomalies.

### Out-of-Scope Use

Detectron2 is not suitable for:
- Tasks unrelated to image-based input, such as natural language processing.
- Applications where low computational resources are a constraint, due to its intensive requirements for model training and inference.

## Bias, Risks, and Limitations

While Detectron2 is highly capable, it inherits biases present in the training data. If models are trained on biased datasets, they may exhibit biased behavior, leading to ethical concerns in applications such as surveillance or autonomous decision-making.

### Recommendations

Users should be aware of potential biases and limitations inherent in the models. It is recommended to:
- Evaluate models on diverse datasets to ensure fair performance across different scenarios.
- Continuously monitor and update models to address any emerging biases.

## How to Get Started with the Model

from detectron2.data import MetadataCatalog

cfg = get_cfg()
cfg.merge_from_file(model_zoo.get_config_file("COCO-InstanceSegmentation/mask_rcnn_R_50_FPN_3x.yaml"))
cfg.MODEL.ROI_HEADS.SCORE_THRESH_TEST = 0.5  # set threshold for this model
cfg.MODEL.WEIGHTS = model_zoo.get_checkpoint_url("COCO-InstanceSegmentation/mask_rcnn_R_50_FPN_3x.yaml")
predictor = DefaultPredictor(cfg)
```
