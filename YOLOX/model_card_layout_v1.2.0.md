# Model Card for layout_v1.2.0

<!-- Provide a quick summary of what the model is/does. -->

The layout_v1.2.0 is YoloX model trained by Unstructured on custom dataset for layout detection tasks. The model is designed to take document image as input and output bounding boxes of layout elements: paragraph, page_number, image, paragraphs_in_image, title, table, paragraphs_in_table, other, page_header, subheading, formulas, page_footer, paragraphs_in_form, checkbox, checkbox_checked, form, radio_button_checked, radio_button, code_snippet. YoloX architecture was introduced in paper 'YOLOX: Exceeding YOLO Series in 2021' by Zheng Ge et al.

## Model Details

### Model Description

<!-- Provide a longer summary of what this model is. -->

The layout_v1.2.0 is YoloX architecture model, an advanced version of the YOLO object detection architecture. Introduced in paper 'YOLOX: Exceeding YOLO Series in 2021' by Zheng Ge et al, developed as part of the SuperGradients repository by Deci-AI, extended with custom post-processing by Unstructured, is a cutting-edge object detection model that focuses on improving speed and accuracy. With various enhancements and optimizations, it enables efficient and precise object detection across a range of applications. The model is designed to take document images as input and output bounding boxes for a list of proprietary layout elements from Unstructured. This design ensures that the inference can be generalized to various types of documents. It is an enhanced version of layout_v1.1.0, with improvements in data quality and an increase in the quantity of training data. The model is trained on a 70K custom dataset specifically for layout detection tasks. The model is not available for public use.
